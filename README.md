This project is expanding on a computational modeling framework for modelling a member-joint truss system for withstanding load.
The project primarily uses Python to allow users to submit, study, and modify truss system designs.
A user is able to investigate how varying loads will affect the structural integrity of a truss and when it will buckle.
The program will also provide automatic calculations on maximum load, cost of of the design, and load to dollar ratio.
