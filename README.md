The purpose of this program is to be a computational modeling framework for modeling a member-joint truss system for withstanding various physical loads. A user can specify various parameters of a truss and then receive information about the truss and whether it will accommodate a given load. The parameters that a user can specify include where members are placed, how long a member is, where an external load is placed on the truss, and how large or small that load is. The program will analyze the given truss and report back the forces in each member, whether each member is in tension or compression, the reaction forces on the joints holding up the truss in x, y, and z directions, the total cost of the truss, and the max load to cost ratio for the design.

The program can be built and run on any computer running Python 3. 
In order to run the program, the user will first need to install Python's matplotlib and scipy libraries.
Once these conditions are met, the user can run the program using the command line command: "Python3 main.py"
